An upload of the final code and documentation from my team's submission for BPA Software Engineering Team in 2014-2015.

We worked on this project during the 2014-2015 school year at Clear Lake High School. Each of the team members had a different role, I was in charge of documentation and the presentation, and did some programming. The project placed 2nd at Nationals.
